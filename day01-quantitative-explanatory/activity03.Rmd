```{r setup, include=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

In the last activity, you might have noticed that I made this Rmd output a document with a type of `github_document` (in the YAML header underneath the title - on line 3) instead of a HTML, Word, or PDF document.
This produces a GitHub friendly Markdown file that GitHub then renders to HTML.
You can read more about this output type in RMarkdown's [documentation page](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/github_document_format.html) if you want to learn more.

# Day 1

## Load the necessary packages

I encourage you to continue using the two packages from Posit (formerly [RStudio](https://posit.co/)): `{tidyverse}` and `{tidymodels}`.
Remember that [Emil Hvitfeldt](https://www.emilhvitfeldt.com/) (of Posit) has put together a [complementary online text](https://emilhvitfeldt.github.io/ISLR-tidymodels-labs/index.html) for the labs in the *ISLR* text that utilize `{tidyverse}` and `{tidymodels}` instead of base R.

- In the **Packages** pane of RStudio, check if `{tidyverse}` and `{tidymodels}` are installed.
  Be sure to check both your **User Library** and **System Library**.
- If either of these are not currently listed (they should be because you verified this in Activity 1), type the following in your **Console** pane, replacing `package_name` with the appropriate name, and  press Enter/Return afterwards.
  
  ```{r  eval = FALSE}
  install.packages("package_name")
  ```

- Once you have verified that both `{tidyverse}` and `{tidymodels}` are installed (in either your user or system library), load these packages in the R chunk below titled `load-packages`.
  
- Run the `load-packages` code chunk or **knit** <img src="../README-img/knit-icon.png" alt="knit" width = "20"/> icon your Rmd document to verify that no errors occur.

```{r load-packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(GGally)

theme_set(ggthemes::theme_few())
```

Since we will be looking at many relationships graphically, it will be nice to not have to code each of these individually.
`{GGally}` is an extension to `{ggplot2}` that reduces some of the complexities when combining multiple plots.
For example, [`GGally::ggpairs`](http://ggobi.github.io/ggally/articles/ggpairs.html) is very handy for pairwise comparisons of multiple variables.

- In the **Packages** pane of RStudio, check if `{GGally}` is already installed.
  Be sure to check both your **User Library** and **System Library**.
- If this is not currently listed, type the following in your **Console** pane and  press Enter/Return afterwards.
  
  ```{r  eval = FALSE}
  install.packages("GGally")
  ```
  
- Once you have verified that `{GGally}` is installed, load it in the R chunk titled `load-packages`.
  
- Run the `setup` code chunk or **knit** <img src="../README-img/knit-icon.png" alt="knit" width = "20"/> icon your Rmd document to verify that no errors occur.

## Load the data and

I found a way to upload data from OpenIntro without needing to download it first!
Recall that data we are working with is from the OpenIntro site (its "about" page: https://www.openintro.org/data/index.php?data=hfi).
We can access the raw data from their tab-delimited text file link: https://www.openintro.org/data/tab-delimited/hfi.txt.

Create a new R code chunk below that is titled `load-data` and reads in the above linked TSV (tab-separated values) file by doing the following:

- Rather than downloading this file, uploading to RStudio, then reading it in, explore how to load this file directly from the provided URL with `readr::read_tsv` (`{readr}` is part of `{tidyverse}`).
- Assign this data set into a data frame named `hfi` (short for "Human Freedom Index").
- Filter the data `hfi` data frame for year 2016 and assigns the result to an R data object named `hfi_2016`. You will use `hfi_2016` for the remainder of this activity.

```{r load-data}
# Load the data directly from the URL
hfi <- read_csv("hfi.csv")

# Filter the data for the year 2016
hfi_2016 <- hfi %>% filter(year == 2016)
```

Get the characteristics of the dataset

```{r}
# Getting the characteristics of the dataset
glimpse(hfi_2016)
```


We will continue using personal freedom scores, `pf_score`, as the response variable and build on our model that had `pf_expression_control` as the explanatory variable. 

Create a new R code chunk below, with an appropriate title, that does the following:

- Review the about page of the data set and select at least one additional numeric variables (hint: look for `<dbl>` or `<int>` designations) to describe its distribution. Remember to write your description.
- You may also wish to do this for `pf_score` and `pf_expression_control` again to help you remember what you noticed last week.

## Pairwise relationships

In Activity 2 you explored simple linear regression models.
Specifically, you fit and assessed this relationship:

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times x + \varepsilon
$$

```{r Pairwise relationships}
# Select additional numeric variables for analysis
# I have identified 'pf_movement_control' and 'pf_religion_control' as additional numeric variables
selected_variables <- hfi_2016 %>%
  select(pf_score, pf_expression_control, pf_movement, pf_religion)

# Summary statistics and distributions of the selected numeric variables
summary(selected_variables)
```


![check-in](../README-img/noun-magnifying-glass.png) **Check in**

Review how you described this model in Activity 2.
  - What were your parameter estimates (i.e., the $\beta$s)?
    How did you interpret these and what did they imply for this scenario?
  - How good of a fit was this model?
    What did you use to assess this?

For this activity, we will begin using the two other quantitative variables to describe the patterns in the response variable.
Take a moment to think about what this previous sentence means:

- What does this mean from a statistical point of view?
- What does this mean from a "real world" point of view (i.e., for your data's situation)?

Now, we will obtain graphical and numerical summaries to describe the pairwise relationships.


- In the code chunk below titled `pairs-plot`, replace "verbatim" with "r" just before the code chunk title.
- Replace `explanatory` in the `select` line with the variable you identified above
- Run your code chunk or knit your document.
  
```{r pairs-plot}
hfi_2016 %>% 
  select(pf_score, pf_expression_control, pf_religion) %>% 
  ggpairs()
```

Note that a warning message (really a list of warning messages) might display in your **Console** and likely under your R code chunk when you knit this report.
In R, warning messages are not necessarily a bad thing and you should read these to make sure you understand what it is informing you of.
To suppress warning messages from displaying after this specific R code chunk when you knit your report, add the follow inside the curly brackets (`{r }`) at the top of your R code chunk (notice the preceding comma): `, warning=FALSE`.

Somewhat related... If you do not want all the messages `{tidyverse}` and `{tidymodels}` produce when you load them, you can add `, message=FALSE` to your `load-packages` R code chunk.

After running the `pairs-plot` code, answer the following questions:

1. For each pair of variables, how would you describe the relationship graphically?
  Do any of the relationships look linear?
  Are there any interesting/odd features (outliers, non-linear patterns, etc.)?
  
*The relationship between `pf_score` and `pf_expression_control` is linear. The points are forming a straight line. No outliers.*

*The relationship between `pf_score` and `pf_religion` is linear with one outliear at the bottom. The points are forming a straight line.*

*The relationship between `pf_expression_control` and `pf_religion` is linear with one outlier at the bottom. The points are forming a straight line.*

2. For each pair of variables, how would you describe the relationship numerically?
+`pf_score` vs `pf_expression_control` have a corr of 0.845. There is a very strong positive linear relationship between personal freedom score and expression control. As expression control increases, the personal freedom score tends to increase significantly. This strong correlation suggests that expression control is a key factor influencing personal freedom scores.
+`pf_score` vs `pf_religion` have a corr of 0.576. There is a moderate positive linear relationship between personal freedom score and religion control. Higher values of religion control are associated with higher personal freedom scores, but the relationship is not as strong as with expression control.
+`pf_expression_control` vs `pf_religion` have a corr of 0.524. There is a moderate positive linear relationship between expression control and religion control. Countries with higher expression control tend to also have higher religion control, but the relationship is less pronounced compared to the relationship between personal freedom score and expression control.

3. Are your two explanatory variables collinear (correlated)?
  Essentially, this means that adding more than one of these variables to the model would not add much value to the model.
  We will talk more on this issue in Activity 4 (other considerations in regression models).
  
*Yes, the two explanatory variables, pf_expression_control and pf_religion, have a correlation coefficient of 0.524. This indicates a moderate positive linear relationship between the two variables, meaning that as one variable increases, the other tends to increase as well. It might be useful to check for multicollinearity using additional diagnostics, such as the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF), to ensure it does not unduly influence the model.*

## The multiple linear regression model

You will now fit the following model:

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times x_1 + \beta_2 \times x_2 + \varepsilon
$$


- In the code chunk below titled `mlr-model`, replace "verbatim" with "r" just before the code chunk title.
- Replace `explanatory`, similarly to what you did in your `pairs-plot` R code chunk.
- Run your code chunk or knit your document.
  
```{r mlr-model}
#fit the mlr model
lm_spec <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_mode("regression") %>%
  set_engine("lm")

lm_spec

mlr_mod <- lm_spec %>% 
fit(pf_score ~ pf_expression_control + pf_religion, data = hfi_2016)

# model output
tidy(mlr_mod)
```

After doing this, answer the following questions:

4. Using your output, write the complete estimated equation for this model.
  Remember in Activity 2 that this looked like:

$$
\hat{y} = 3.46 + 0.469 \times x_1+ 0.161 \times x_2
$$
  
  where $b_0$ and $b_1$ were your model parameter estimates.
  Note that your model here will be different (and have more terms).

5. For each of the estimated parameters (the *y*-intercept and the slopes associated with each explanatory variable - three total), interpret these values in the context of this problem.
  That is, what do they mean for a "non-data" person?
  
+Intercept = 3.46. The intercept represents the estimated personal freedom (`pf_score`) when there is no freedom of expression (`pf_expression_control`) or freedom of religion (`pf_religion`) in a country. It is statistically significant (p < 0.001).

+`pf_expression_control` estimate = 0.469 indicates that for each unit increase in pf_expression_control, the pf_score increases by approximately 0.469, holding pf_religion constant. This variable is highly significant (p < 0.001).

+`pf_religion` estimate = 0.16 indicates that for each unit increase in pf_religion, the pf_score increases by approximately 0.161, holding pf_expression_control constant. This variable is also statistically significant (p < 0.001).

## Challenge: 3-D plots

In Introduction to Statistical Learning with R (ISLR), *ISL*, the authors provided a 3-D scatterplot with a plane that represents the estimated model.
Do some internet sleuthing to minimally produce a 3-D scatterplot (you do not need to include the plane).
Ideally, this would be something that plays nicely with (looks similar to) `{ggplot2}`.

- Create a new R code chunk, with a descriptive name, and add your code to create this plot.

```{r 3-D plot, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load necessary libraries
library(plotly)
library(ggplot2)

# Create 3D scatter plot
plot_ly(hfi_2016, 
        x = ~pf_expression_control, 
        y = ~pf_religion, 
        z = ~pf_score,
        type = 'scatter3d',
        mode = 'markers') %>%
  layout(scene = list(
    xaxis = list(title = 'pf_expression_control'),
    yaxis = list(title = 'pf_religion'),
    zaxis = list(title = 'pf_score')
  ))
```


After doing this, respond to the following prompt:

6. Compare your 3-D scatterplot and the `GGally::ggpairs` output.
  Comment on the strengths and weaknesses of these two visualizations.
  Do both display on GitHub when you push your work there?
  
+The 3-D plot is more interactive in terms of zooming, rotating and it also visualizes all the variables simultaneously allowing for a holistic view of the data.
  
+On the downside the 3-D plot might be complex to interpret sometimes and it my also suffer from overplotting making points to overlap hence difficult to distinguish individual points.

+The `ggpairs` provides detailed pairwise comparison, it is easy to interpret and it provides plots for distribution and correlation which is a comprehensive overview of the data.

+On the downside the  `ggpairs` is static which limits interactive exploration of the data and it is limited to pairwise relationships.

+`GGally::ggpairs` is displayed correctly in Github while 3-D plot is not displayed directly due to its interactive nature

# Day 2

During Day 1, you fit a model with one quantitative response variable and two quantitative explanatory variables.
Now we look at a model with one quantitative explanatory variable and one qualitative explanatory variable.
We will use the full 2016 dataset for this entire activity.
For the Mini-Competition next week, you will be instructed to use the train/test split process. 

## Fitting the overall model

This is similar to what we have already been doing - fitting our desired model.
For today's activity, we will fit something like:

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{qualitative\\_variable} + \beta_2 \times \text{quantitative\\_variable} + \varepsilon
$$

where $y$, $\text{qualitative\\_variable}$, and $\text{quantitative\\_variable}$ are from `hfi_2016`.
Note that the two explanatory variables can be entered in whatever order.

To help with interpretability, we will focus on qualitative predictor variables with only two levels.
Unfortunately, none of the current `chr` variables have only two levels.
Fortunately, we can create our own.


- In the code chunk below titled `binary-pred`, replace "verbatim" with "r" just before the code chunk title.
- Run your code chunk or knit your document.
  
```{r binary-pred}
hfi_2016 <- hfi_2016 %>%
  mutate(west_atlantic = if_else(
    region %in% c("North America", "Latin America & the Caribbean"),
    "No",
    "Yes"
  ))
```

7. What is happening in the above code? What new variable did we create? How do you know it is new? What values does it take when?

*We are creating a new binary qualitative variable called `west_atlantic.` If the region is "North America" or "Latin America & the Caribbean", then west_atlantic is assigned the value "No". Otherwise, west_atlantic is assigned the value "Yes".*


- In the code chunk below titled `qual-mlr`, replace "verbatim" with "r" just before the code chunk title.
- Run your code chunk or knit your document.

```{r qual-mlr}
# review any visual patterns
hfi_2016 %>% 
  select(pf_score, west_atlantic, pf_expression_control) %>% 
  ggpairs()

#fit the mlr model
lm_spec <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_mode("regression") %>%
  set_engine("lm")

qual_mod <- lm_spec %>% 
  fit(pf_score ~ west_atlantic + pf_expression_control, data = hfi_2016)

# model output
tidy(qual_mod)
```

When looking at your `ggpairs` output, remember to ask yourself, "does it make sense to include all of these variables?"
Specifically, if you notice that the response variables are highly correlated (collinear), including both does not necessarily add much value as they are essentially saying the same thing.
Note: There are more advanced methods to include the variability within a rater for our model - this is beyond STA 631.
If this sounds of interest to you, explore *generalized estimating equations* (GEE) or *generalized linear mixed models* (GLMM).
However, there are often times when we choose to include variables in our model because it is important to us - for various reasons.
Regardless, I encourage you to keep your readings of *DF* in mind - who will benefit by including this information; who will be hurt by including this information? 

Also, when looking at your model (`tidy`) output, the `term` label for your qualitative explanatory variable look odd.
Answer the following questions:

8. What is the label that R assigned to this explanatory variable `term`?

`west_atlanticYes`


9. What information is represented here?

Intercept (4.3771413):

This represents the estimated average pf_score for the baseline category of `west_atlantic`, which is "No". So, for countries not in the Western Atlantic region, the average pf_score is approximately 4.377.

`west_atlanticYes` (-0.1024089):

This coefficient represents the difference in the estimated average pf_score between the "Yes" and "No" categories of `west_atlantic`, holding `pf_expression_control` constant. Since the p-value (0.5413382) is greater than 0.05, this difference is not statistically significant. This means there is no significant difference in `pf_score` between Western Atlantic and non-Western Atlantic countries.

`pf_expression_control` (0.5401164):

This coefficient represents the estimated change in pf_score for a one-unit increase in `pf_expression_control`, holding `west_atlantic` constant. The positive value (0.5401164) indicates that higher expression control is associated with higher personal freedom scores. The p-value (1.005691e-44) is highly significant, indicating a strong relationship.


10. What information is missing here?

Degrees of Freedom: These values indicate the degrees of freedom associated with the t-statistics and p-values. Degrees of freedom are typically calculated as the difference between the total number of observations and the number of parameters estimated in the model.

Confidence Intervals: Confidence intervals provide a range of values within which the true population parameter is likely to lie with a certain level of confidence. Including confidence intervals along with coefficient estimates gives a sense of the precision of the estimates.

Residual Standard Error (RSE): The residual standard error represents the average amount that the response variable (pf_score) deviates from the fitted regression line. It provides a measure of the spread of the residuals around the regression line.

R-squared (or Adjusted R-squared): R-squared measures the proportion of variability in the response variable that is explained by the predictor variables in the model. It provides an overall assessment of the model's goodness of fit.

F-statistic and associated p-value: These statistics assess the overall significance of the model by comparing the fit of the full model to a model with no predictors. They indicate whether the predictor variables, taken together, have a significant effect on the response variable.


Your are essentially fitting two models (or $k$ models, where $k$ is the number of levels in your qualitative variable).
From your reading, you learned that R is creating an indicator variable (see p. 83).
If you have 3 levels in your qualitative variable, you would have 2 (3 - 1) indicator variables.
If you have $k$ levels in your qualitative variable, you would have $k - 1$ indicator variables.

The decision for R to call the indicator variable by one of your levels instead of the other has no deeper meaning.
R simply codes the level that comes first alphabetically with a $0$ for your indicator variable.
You can change this reference level of a categorical variable, which is the level that is coded as a 0, using the `relevel` function.
Use `?relevel` to learn more.

11. Write the estimated equation for your MLR model with a qualitative explanatory variable.


$$
\hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{west_atlanticYes} + \beta_2 \times \text{pf_expression_control} + \varepsilon
$$

12. Now, for each level of your qualitative variable, write the simplified equation of the estimated line for that level. 
  Note that if your qualitative variable has two levels, you should have two simplified equations.

When `west_atlantic` is "Yes":

$$
\hat{y}{Yes} = \beta_0 - \beta_1 + \beta_2 \times \text{pf_expression_control}
$$

When `west_atlantic` is "No":

$$
\hat{y}{No} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 + \beta_2 \times \text{pf_expression_control} 
$$

Where:

$$\hat{y}{Yes}$$
represents the predicted value of the response variable (pf_score) when west_atlantic is "Yes".
$$\hat{y}{No}$$
  represents the predicted value of the response variable (pf_score) when west_atlantic is "No".
$$\beta_0, \beta_1 and, \beta_2$$
  are the estimated coefficients from the MLR model.
`pf_expression_control` is the quantitative explanatory variable representing the level of expression and control of personal freedom in a country.
These equations show how the predicted personal freedom score varies with changes in the level of expression and control of personal freedom (`pf_expression_control`) for each level of the qualitative variable `west_atlantic`.


The interpretation of the coefficients (parameter estimates) in multiple regression is slightly different from that of simple regression.
The estimate for the indicator variable reflects how much more a group is expected to be if something has that quality, *while holding all other variables constant*.
The estimate for the quantitative variable reflects how much change in the response variable occurs due to a 1-unit increase in the quantitative variable, *while holding all other variables constant*.

13. Interpret the parameter estimate for the reference level of your categorical variable in the context of your problem.
Page 83 of the text can help here (or have me come chat with you).


In the context of our problem, the reference level of the categorical variable `west_atlantic` is "No". The parameter estimate for the reference level reflects the expected change in the response variable (`pf_score`) when the categorical variable is at its reference level, while holding all other variables constant.

For the reference level "No" of `west_atlantic`, the parameter estimate (-0.102) indicates that, on average, countries within the "No" category are expected to have a lower personal freedom score compared to the reference level, "Yes", of the `west_atlantic` variable, while controlling for the level of expression and control of personal freedom (`pf_expression_control`).

In other words, countries within the "No" category, which includes regions outside the West Atlantic area, are expected to have a lower personal freedom score by approximately 0.102 units compared to countries within the West Atlantic region, all else being equal.

14. Interpret the parameter estimate for your quantitative variable in the context of your problem.

For each one-unit increase in the `pf_expression_control` score, the personal freedom score (`pf_score`) is expected to increase by approximately 0.540 units on average, controlling for the effect of the categorical variable west_atlantic.

## Challenge: Multiple levels

Below, create a new R code chunk (with a descriptive name) that fits a new model with the same response (`pf_score`) and quantitative explanatory variable (`pf_expression_control`), but now use a qualitative variable with more than two levels (say, `region`) and obtain the `tidy` model output.
How does R appear to handle categorical variables with more than two levels?

```{r more than 2 levels}
# Fitting the model with a qualitative variable with more than two levels
lm_spec_multiple_levels <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_mode("regression") %>%
  set_engine("lm")

# Fit the model
qual_mod_multiple_levels <- lm_spec_multiple_levels %>% 
  fit(pf_score ~ region + pf_expression_control, data = hfi_2016)

# Display the model output
tidy(qual_mod_multiple_levels)
```

`R` appears to handle categorical variables with more than two levels by automatically converting them into dummy variables, where each level becomes its own binary variable. The output provides parameter estimates for each level of the categorical variable, except for one reference level, which serves as the baseline for comparison.

# Day 3

We will explore a MLR model with an interaction between quantitative and qualitative explanatory variables as well as see some other methods to assess the fit of our model.
From the modeling process we came up with as a class, we will now address the "series of important questions that we should consider when performing multiple linear regression" (*ISL* [Section 3.2.2](https://hastie.su.domains/ISLR2/ISLRv2_website.pdf), p. 75):

1. Is at least one of the $p$ predictors $X_1$, $X_2$, $\ldots$, $X_p$ useful in predicting the response $Y$?
2. Do all the predictors help to explain $Y$, or is only a subset of the predictors useful?
3. How well does the model fit the data?
4. Given a set of predictor values, what response value should we predict and how accurate is our prediction?

Note that the text (*ISLR*) covers interactions between two quantitative explanatory variables as well.
By including an interaction term in our model, it may seem like we are relaxing the "additive assumption" a little.
However, the additive assumption is about the coefficients (the $\beta$s) and not the variables.

## Fitting the overall model with $qualitative \times quantitative$ interaction

Recall from Day 2 that you explored the model:

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{qualitative\\_variable} + \beta_2 \times \text{quantitative\\_variable} + \varepsilon
$$

Today we will explore a similar model, except that also includes the interaction between your qualitative and quantitative explanatory variables.
That is,

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{qualitative\\_variable} + \beta_2 \times \text{quantitative\\_variable} + \beta_3 \times ( \text{qualitative\\_variable} \times \text{quantitative\\_variable}) + \varepsilon
$$

- Run all previous code up to this point - you will need your prior dataset of just 2016 observations with the `west_atlantic` variable.
- In the code chunk below titled `int-mlr`, replace "verbatim" with "r" just before the code chunk title.
- Run your code chunk or knit your document.

```{r int-mlr}
# review any visual patterns
hfi_2016 %>% 
  select(pf_score, west_atlantic, pf_expression_control) %>% 
  ggpairs()

#fit the mlr model
lm_spec <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_mode("regression") %>%
  set_engine("lm")

int_mod <- lm_spec %>% 
  fit(pf_score ~ west_atlantic * pf_expression_control, data = hfi_2016)

# model output
tidy(int_mod)
```

Note that I shortened the model statement using `qualitative * quantitative`, but this can sometimes be confusing to read.
Another way to write the right-hand side of the equation is: `qualitative + quantitative + qualitative * quantitative`.

After doing this, answer the following question:

15. When viewing the `tidy` output, notice that the interaction term is listed as `qualitativelevel:quantitative`.
  Referring back to Day 2 with how R displays qualitative variables, interpret what this syntax means.
  
$$\beta_3$$
: Represents the additional change in `pf_score` for a one-unit increase in `pf_expression_control` when `west_atlantic` is "Yes" compared to "No".

The qualitativelevel:quantitative term indicates that the effect of the quantitative variable (`pf_expression_control`) on the response variable (`pf_score`) is modified by the qualitative variable (`west_atlantic`).

In simpler terms, it shows that the relationship between `pf_expression_control` and `pf_score` is different depending on whether a region is classified as "Yes" or "No" in the `west_atlantic` variable.


16. Using page 100 of *ISLR* as a reference, if needed, and your work from Day 2, write the simplified equation of the line corresponding to each level of your qualitative explanatory variable.

To write the simplified equations of the line corresponding to each level of the qualitative explanatory variable, we'll break down the model into its components based on the levels of `west_atlantic.` Here’s the model again:

$$\hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{west_atlantic} + \beta_2 \times \text{pf_expression_control} + \beta_3 \times (\text{west_atlantic} \times \text{pf_expression_control})$$

### Simplified Equations for Each Level

For `west_atlantic` = "No" (reference level):
When `west_atlantic` is "No", the term `west_atlantic` and the interaction term `west_atlanticYes`:`pf_expression_control` both drop out because they are zero. Thus, the equation simplifies to:

$$\hat{y}_{\text{No}} = \beta_0 + \beta_2 \times \text{pf_expression_control}$$

Substituting in the values:

$$\hat{y}_{\text{No}} = 5.7213860 + 0.2961044 \times \text{pf_expression_control}$$

For `west_atlantic` = "Yes":
When `west_atlantic` is "Yes", both the `west_atlantic` term and the interaction term `west_atlanticYes`:`pf_expression_control` are included. Thus, the equation is:

$$\hat{y}_{\text{Yes}} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 + \beta_2 \times \text{pf_expression_control} + \beta_3 \times \text{pf_expression_control}$$

Combining the coefficients:

$$\hat{y}_{\text{Yes}} = 5.7213860 + (-1.5979076) + (0.2961044 + 0.2750385) \times \text{pf_expression_control}$$

Simplifying further:

$$\hat{y}_{\text{Yes}} = 4.1234784 + 0.5711429 \times \text{pf_expression_control}$$

### Summary of Simplified Equations

For `west_atlantic` = "No":
$$\hat{y}_{\text{No}} = 5.7213860 + 0.2961044 \times \text{pf_expression_control}$$

For `west_atlantic` = "Yes":
$$\hat{y}_{\text{Yes}} = 4.1234784 + 0.5711429 \times \text{pf_expression_control}$$


17. For two observations with similar values of the quantitative , which level tends to have higher values of the response variable?

The intercept for the "No" group is higher than the intercept for the "Yes" group by 

5.7213860−4.1234784=1.5979076. This means that when `pf_expression_control` is 0, the "No" group has a higher `pf_score.`

The slope for the "Yes" group is higher than the slope for the "No" group by 

0.5711429−0.2961044=0.2750385. This means that as `pf_expression_control` increases, the `pf_score` increases more rapidly for the "Yes" group compared to the "No" group.

#### Conclusion
For low values of `pf_expression_control` (close to 0), the "No" group tends to have higher `pf_score` values because of the higher intercept.
For higher values of `pf_expression_control`, the "Yes" group will eventually have higher pf_score values because of the higher slope. The exact point where this crossover happens can be calculated, but generally speaking, as `pf_expression_control` increases, the Yes group benefits more due to the larger coefficient.

18. Like you did in Day 1, assess the fit of this model (no need to do any formal hypothesis testing - we will explore this next).
  How does `int_mod`'s fit compare to `mlr_mod`?
  What did you use to compare these?
  Why?

```{r examining model fit}
# I will refit the Day 1 model here to have them both in one place for comparison
# Fit the models
#mlr_mod <- tidymodels::lm(pf_score ~ west_atlantic + pf_expression_control, data = hfi_2016)
#int_mod <- tidymodels::lm(pf_score ~ west_atlantic * pf_expression_control, data = hfi_2016)

# Extract model summaries
#mlr_mod_summary <- summary(mlr_mod)
#int_mod_summary <- summary(int_mod)

# Extract R-squared and Adjusted R-squared
#mlr_mod_r2 <- mlr_mod_summary$r.squared
#mlr_mod_adj_r2 <- mlr_mod_summary$adj.r.squared
#int_mod_r2 <- int_mod_summary$r.squared
#int_mod_adj_r2 <- int_mod_summary$adj.r.squared

# Display the results
#data.frame(
  #Model = c("MLR", "Interaction MLR"),
  #R2 = c(mlr_mod_r2, int_mod_r2),
  #Adjusted_R2 = c(mlr_mod_adj_r2, int_mod_adj_r2))
```

*I am using R^2 and Adjusted R^2*

#### Why These Metrics?
*R^2: Represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. It is a measure of how well the model explains the data.*
 
*Adjusted R^2: Adjusted for the number of predictors in the model. It is a more accurate measure for comparing models with different numbers of predictors, as it accounts for the complexity of the model.*
 
*Using these metrics allows us to quantitatively assess and compare the fit of different models. The interaction model appears to fit the data better because it has a higher R^2 and higher Adjusted R^2, suggesting that the interaction between the qualitative and quantitative variables provides additional explanatory power.*

Recall our brief discussion on how many disciplines are moving away from $p$-values in favor of other methods.
We will explore $p$-values these other methods later this semester, but we will practice our classical methods here.
This is known as an "overall $F$ test" and the hypotheses are:

That (the null) no predictors are useful for the model (i.e., all slopes are equal to zero) versus the alternative that at least one predictor is useful for the model (i.e., at least one slope is not zero).
One way to check this is to build our null model (no predictors) and then compare this to our candidate model (`int_mod`).

- In the code chunk below titled `mod-comp`, replace "verbatim" with "r" just before the code chunk title.
  
```{r mod-comp}
# null model
null_mod <- lm_spec %>% 
fit(pf_score  ~ 1, data = hfi_2016)

anova(
  extract_fit_engine(int_mod),
  extract_fit_engine(null_mod)
)
```

19. Using your background knowledge of $F$ tests, what is the $F$ test statistic and $p$-value for this test?
  Based on an $\alpha = 0.05$ significant level, what should you conclude?

The $F$ test statistic for this test is 144.6, and the associated $p$-value is nearly zero (given as < 2.2e-16).

At a significance level of $\alpha = 0.05$, since the $p$-value is much smaller than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. This indicates that at least one predictor in the interaction model (west_atlantic * pf_expression_control) is useful for predicting the response variable (pf_score).

## Partial slope test - do all predictors help explain $y$?

Assuming that your overall model is significant (at least one predictor is useful), we will continue on.
Continue through these next tasks even if your overall model was not significant.

We could do a similar process to fit a new model while removing one explanatory variable at at time, and using `anova` to compare these models.
However, the `tidy` output also helps here (the `statistic` and `p.value` columns).

For each slope, you are testing if that slope is zero (when including the other variables, the null) or if it is not zero (when including the other variables, the alternative).
Because the interaction term is a combination of the other two variables, we should assess the first.

20. What is the $t$ test statistic and $p$-value associated with this test?
  Based on an $\alpha = 0.05$ significant level, what should you conclude?

The $t$ test statistic and $p$-value associated with the partial slope test for the interaction term `west_atlanticYes`:pf_expression_control are as follows:

$t$ test statistic: 3.283544
$p$-value:1.262236×10 −3
 
Based on an $\alpha = 0.05$ significance level, since the $p$-value (1.262236×10 −3) is less than $\alpha$, we reject the null hypothesis that the coefficient of the interaction term is zero. Therefore, we conclude that the interaction between `west_atlanticYes` and `pf_expression_control` significantly contributes to explaining the response variable.

If your interaction term was not significant, you could consider removing it.
Now look at your two non-interaction terms...

21. What are the $t$ test statistic and $p$-value associated with these tests?
  Based on an $\alpha = 0.05$ significant level, what should you conclude about these two predictors?



You would not need to do (21) if the interaction was significant.
You also should not remove a main variable (non-interaction variable) if the interaction variable remains in your model.

## Residual assessment - how well does the model fit the data?

You have already done this step in past activities by exploring your residuals (Activity 2).
Using your final model from Task 3, assess how well your model fits the data.

To assess how well the model fits the data, we can examine the residuals from the final model obtained in Task 3. We'll look for patterns or trends in the residuals that might indicate inadequacies in the model fit. This can include checking for:

+Randomness: Residuals should be randomly scattered around zero without any discernible pattern.

+Homoscedasticity: The spread of residuals should be roughly constant across different levels of the predictors.

+Normality: Residuals should follow a roughly normal distribution.

Let's extract residuals

```{r residuals}
# Extract residuals from the final model
residuals <- residuals(int_mod)
```

Now that we have extracted the residuals, we can create several plots to assess the model fit:

+Scatterplot of Residuals vs. Predicted Values: This plot helps us check for randomness and homoscedasticity.

+QQ Plot of Residuals: This plot helps us assess the normality assumption of residuals.

+Residuals vs. Predictor Variables: These plots help us detect any patterns or trends in the residuals with respect to the predictor variables.

Let's create these plots:

```{r}

```
